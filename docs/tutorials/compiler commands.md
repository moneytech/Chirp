# Using the compiler

To use a programming language you need two things, knowing how to write the language, and how to use the compiler(having the compiler is important too). This tutorial will be focused on how to use the *experimental* Chirp compiler. 

# Compiling a file

The compiler will **always** take the filename as the first argument, you also cannot have more than one file, because the file you give to the compiler shall always have an ``entry`` function, and you can't have two entries.

# Verbose output

If you want to see debug messages, you can use the ``-v`` option.
